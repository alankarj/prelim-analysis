SARA, 00:16.00, I’m at Davos to assist the attendees but to be honest I’m a little anxious about it it’s my first time here what about you, 00:24.58
User, 00:25.19, it’s my first time too, 00:25.85
SARA, 00:27.91, I am sure they’re rolling out the red carpet for you (laughing) if you wouldn’t mind sharing your goals for attending Davos this year I can try to help you achieve them, 00:37.15
User, 00:38.15, okay, 00:38.20
SARA, 00:40.06, so what can I help you with what are your goals in being at Davos, 00:44.17
User, 00:45.37, well I guess it’s to understand what’s in Europe world leaders are thinking and where things are going, 00:55.18
SARA, 00:57.70, that’s very sensible so you know about my job can you tell me a little bit about your work, 01:03.95

User, 02:02.72, yes, 02:02.77
SARA, 02:04.70, I had a feeling maybe it’s the robot version of a woman’s intuition so I can send you a message in Top link a private message app to remind you of the details of this session or you can just jot them down or take a photo of the screen would you like me to send you a reminder, 02:23.10
User, 02:23.95, yes please that would be wonderful [thanks], 02:27.94

User, 03:22.11, no I think you don’t have to, 03:24.75
SARA, 03:26.95, it can be hard to keep track of information on the go you might want to take a photo of the screen so you can send (inaudible) a message through the private message function in Top link later, 03:37.12
