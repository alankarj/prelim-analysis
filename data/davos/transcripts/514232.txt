SARA, 02:22.4, oh good I'm glad I tried asking but they wouldn't tell me I am so sorry about that so I can do one of two things I can send a message to the attendee introducing you or I can give you the information and you can reach out yourself would you like me to send a message introducing you, 02:44.0
